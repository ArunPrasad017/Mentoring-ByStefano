Action: Create the repository and add the meeting logs
Date - March 16, 2021
- ELB
- AWS service
- Standard application(EC2)
    - Flask app or not ?
- ECS - custom version that AWS Is developing 
    - Orchestrates images in BTS
    - AWS maybe does the implementation with EC2
    - Cost?
- Minikube not working (Itâ€™s on our machine so not scalable)/ on Ec2 might not be a good solution.
- Datasette Front end - uses plugins and no need to setup additional frameworks for making it work
- Lambda option for datasette? As an alternate to docker deployment 
    - Identify more regarding this option
    - When not huge amount of data is present then we can obtain it
- Next test: Try an option with docker rather than with other, use examples of web application
    - Not an issue with CI tool
    - ELB alternatives (free source) or ECS (Deploying a container)
